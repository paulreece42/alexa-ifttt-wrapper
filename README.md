Used with the Amazon Alexa IFTTT channel to trigger reboots of my VMs

For example: "Alexa, trigger reboot myserver"

Saves my girlfriend having to call me up just to reboot a media server
VM when she can't watch TV and hey, pretty convenient with the Alexa
remote on the FireTV

More functionality coming as there's a need for it

One issue currently is that I needed a quick and dirty
of verification query for salt, basically what "SELECT 1"
is to SQL, so I just ping the name of my salt
master. This needs changing.
